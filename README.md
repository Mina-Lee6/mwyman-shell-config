mwyman-shell-config
===================

I've needed to recreate my bash shell profile more often than I care to, and
decided that I should really setup a Github repo that would contain my shell
setup.

I don't care if anybody else finds this helpful- it will make my life easier
the next time my machine gets wiped or I get a new one.
